# About this branch

This is a mirror of [Samu/Xhyzi's Day, Night and Seasons System](https://github.com/Xhyzi/pokeemerald/tree/day-and-night) made in case he ever decides to delete the branch.

It's an implementation directly based off Prime-dialga's DNS tool for binary hacking that implements this system in ROMs of Pokémon FireRed.

I'm storing it here for archiving purposes.

The implementation is not hardware efficient in the slightest and its author doesn't intend to update it anymore either.

However, it is easy to merge and gets the job done for newbies, so I think it's work preserving.
