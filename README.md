# About this branch

I made a custom starter selection because I was bored and I haven't done anything with the decomps in a while.

I replaced the Frame option with a selector that lets you pick which generation of Pokémon species you want for your starter.

I used SBird's dynamic multichoice system because the idea was to offer the choice with a good ol' multichoice, but vanilla's system sucks ass.

I don't expect anyone to use this, and I'm sure not gonna do it myself.

I was just bored, there's nothing else to this.
